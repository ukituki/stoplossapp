When you buy a stock you hope its price will rise.\n2. But you should also be prepared for an adverse scenario. \n3. Stop Loss order defines you maximum acceptable risk in a given trade.  \n  \n  <br>\n  <br>\n  <br>\n  \nIf market goes against you, your losses are be limited and you still have capital to trade when the next opportunity appears. \n\n--- \n\n## Example\n<img src=\"assets/img/stoploss.png\" height=\"640px\" width=\"480px\" />\n\n- You buy 1 share of Google at the current price (590 USD) and set your Stop Loss 5% below that level (at 560 USD)\n- Your risk in this trade is limited to $30 per 1 share. \n- If price falls below $560 you cut your losses and exit trade with a small loss. \n\n\n--- \n\n## Problem\n\n**Question is how many shares of Google should you buy to control your risk?**\n\nLet's say your portfolio value is $50,000.\n\n_The good practice, to stay in the game for a long run, is not to risk more than 2% of your total capital in any single trade._\n\n<br>\n\nMax. risk per trade: 0.02 * 50000 = 1000\nYou should buy: 1000  / 30  = **33 shares of Google**\n(total risk per trade) / (risk per 1 share)\n\n<br><br>\n[Stop Loss App](http://ukituki.shinyapps.io/positionsizing/) was created to simplify this calculation.\n\n--- &radio\n\n## What is the focus of most successful investors?\n\n1. Finding the best stocks \n2. _Controling risk (e.g. using stop loss orders)_\n3. Following the trend\n4. Contrarian mindset (going against the crowd)\n\n\n\n*** .hint\nIt's related to the Stop Losses and adjusting size of positions in portfolio.\n\n*** .explanation\n\nInvestors who constantly beat the markets usually cut losses quickly and let their winners run. \n\n[Play with the Stop Loss App](http://ukituki.shinyapps.io/positionsizing/) \n\n",
